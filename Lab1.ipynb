Yet almost all of these are actually just $P(w_n|w_{n-1}) = \\frac{k}{N + k|V|}$, with $k$ the value with which you smooth and $N=C(w_{n-1})$.

Hence, smoothing redistributate the distribution amongst the poor. We tried with different k (k=1 and k=0.01) in order to understand the effect of smoothing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the most frequent word, we can observe in the plots that a small k leads to a decreased smoothing. The probability distributions will be similar to the non-smoothed bigram if we utilize a small-k. On the other hand, applying a k=1 is translated into a more balanced distribution of the probabilities. In the non frequent word, the probabilities tend to increase with a small k as it have less efect on the probabilities.\n",

        "By looking at the formula, we can imply why the probabilities of the non frequent word, \"seen\", sharply incrases compared to the frequent word, \"the\", with a small-k. Infrequent words will have lower counts, and the effect of k in the denominator would be significantly more important and it could incresase its probability more than for frequent words which have higher counts. This is because a small k will diminishes the denominator as it decreases the influence of V, consequently it increases the probability. Hence, with a small-k the probabilities of the words for \"seen\" are way higher than for a k=1.\n",
        "\n",
        "To sum up, using a small k decreases the effect of the smoothing and the probability distribution will be more similar to a non-smoothing biagram's distribution but the effect on frequents and non-frequent words will be different according to the mathematical formula."

Particularly, for each of these n-grams there is one phrase that has zero probabilities in the non-smoothed n-gram and a probability higher than zero in the smoothed one. Hence, the smoothed-n-gram is able to generalize better because it gives more opportunities to unseen, or uncommon data.

        "The perplexity is used for evaluating probabilistic mudels such as language models. This metric is the inverse probability of the sentence normalized by the number of words. Thus, we could expect to have a low perplexity with higher probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in a way, perplexity gives us insight into how surprised (or perplexed) the model is when it sees new data. This is illustrated in these graphics where we observe higher perplexity in sentences with low probability and the opposite in sentences with high probability. In the sentences that we are plotting we see a decreasing of perplexity and this downward trend indicates that the model is becoming more confident and certain in its predictions, resulting in a lower perplexity score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, it is important to understand that lower levels of confusion do not necessarily mean more perfect modeling, but better performance. Models with low ambiguity scores have a stronger understanding of the underlying patterns and structures in the language being modelled."

        "\n",
        "By now you should have a solid feeling for the problem of **sparsity in language data**; there's just never enough data. For the task of language modelling, we saw that sparsity is a serious challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "It would be great to be able to model $p(w_n|w_1 \\dots w_{n-1})$ for unlimited $n$: the larger $n$ the better our language model should become at capturing the long-range dependencies between words that characterize actual human sentences, and the more probability our model will assign to such sentences as opposed to sentences that are word-soup. But in the N-gram approach, increasing $n$ will quickly kill all generalizing abilities of the model: the model will start to assign probabilities only to sentences it has seen in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, where to go from here? Here are three directions that we could head in.\n",

        "### Smoothing\n",
        "\n",
        "We have seen one example of smoothing in this lab: add-k smoothing. This is an easy method, both conceptually and implementation-wise. But the results are not great, and the effects it has on the distributions can be extreme.\n",
        "\n",
        "A much more sophisticated method of smoothing is **Kneser-Ney smoothing**. The method is described in detail in section 4.5 of J&M (3rd edition). This is one of the best-performing N-gram smoothing methods, and up to a few years ago, a popular implementation of it called [KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) gave state-of-the-art results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### From words to characters\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab we have considered language modeling as the task of predicting a **word** $w_n$ based on a history of **words** $w_1\\cdots w_n$. What if instead we let our basic units of modelling be **characters**? The task then becomes to model $p(c_k\\mid c_{k-N-1}\\dots c_{k-1})$ where each $c_i$ is now an ASCII character instead of an entire word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly sparsity of data is no longer a problem! The set of characters to use is tiny (< 100) compared to even a small-sized vocabulary as today. Have a look at this very illustrative notebook written by Yoav Golberg to see such a method in action: [The unreasonable effectiveness of Character-level Language Models](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/yoavg/d76121dfde2618422139).\n",
        "\n",
        "(So what is the downside?)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Neural language models\n",
        "\n",
        "The above notebook was actually written as a response to this blog post by Andrej Karpathy: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Go ahead and read it if you haven't already: it is a superb introduction to the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural language models solve the problem of data sparsity in a different manner. Instead of estimating the probabilities $p(w_k\\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1})$ by counting occurrences in the data, they use a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ parametrized by parameters $\\theta$ to predict this probability. The parameters $\\theta$ are learned through optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest approach goes like this: each word in the history $w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}$ is embedded separately giving vectors $e_{k-N-1}\\dots e_{k-1}$ and then concatenated into one long vector $[e_{k-N-1};\\dots ;e_{k-1}]$. The network then uses this history vector to predict a probability distribution over words $w$ in the vocabulary $V$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$p(w \\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}) = f_{\\theta}([e_{k-N-1};\\dots;e_{k-1}]).$$\n",
        "\n",
        "(In order to produce legitimate probabilities the final layer of such a network will be for example a $softmax$.)\n",
        "\n",
        "This provides a solution to the sparsity problem by having the network let the individual embeddings of the words in the history interact through its non-linear transformation. We are letting the network figure out the smoothing itself!\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs are a clever extension of this idea, where a hidden state vector $h$ is re-used and updated at each step $k$ in order to store the information of the entire history up to step $k-1$. That is, an RNN actually does away with the N-order approximation; it tries to model the full conditional directly! That means that\n",
        "\n",
        "$$p(w \\mid w_1\\dots w_{k-1}) \\approx RNN_{\\theta}([e_{k-1};h_{k-1}])$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the hidden state $h_{k-1}$ is a compression of the *entire history* $w_1\\dots w_{k-1}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another great place to learn about RNNs, their problems, and solutions to those, is on the blog of [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",
        "\n",

        "(And now, it's time to read the classic essay by Eugene Wigner that gave both of the posts their title: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html))"
